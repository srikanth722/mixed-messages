## General Information
The purpose of this project is to write a message generator program. Every time a user runs the program, they will get a new, randomized output. To make the program truly random, the message that it outputs will be made up of at least three different pieces of data. The theme of these messages will resemble that of a Fortune Cookie.

### Project Objectives
- Build a message generator program using JavaScript
- Use Git version control
- Use command line
- Develop locally on your computer

### Project Prerequisites
- JavaScript
- Git and GitHub
- Command line


## Technologies Used
- JavaScript


## Usage
Run the script.js file locally or on the Chrome Dev Tools console.


## Project Status
Project is: _complete_ 


## Room for Improvement
- Create a nested array to store the message components
- Create a function to create an array of message components


## Acknowledgements
This project was based on the JavaScript Portfolio Project as part of the Full Stack Engineer Path on [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com).
